# Planteome data retreival 
The scripts in this directory are to download [Planteome](https://planteome.org/) from the [ViewVC repo](http://palea.cgrb.oregonstate.edu/viewsvn/associations/). The scripts in this directory, `download.yaml` and `download_utils.py` are adapted from scripts of the same name originally written by [Anne Thessen](https://github.com/diatomsRcool) (annethessen[at]gmail[dot]com) for the [eco-kg](https://github.com/diatomsRcool/eco-kg) repo.
<br><br>
`download_utils.py` was modified to run as a command line script. `download.yaml` will eventually be modified to change which things are imported.

    "In order to apply a pre-trained model to unlabeled data, some formatting requirements must be met. From the [docs](https://github.com/dwadden/dygiepp/blob/master/doc/data.md): \n",
    "* \"In the case where your unlabeled data are stored as a directory of `.txt` files (one file per document), you can run `python scripts/data/new-dataset/format_new_dataset.py [input-directory] [output-file]` to format the documents into a `jsonl` file, with one line per document. If your dataset is scientific text, add the `--use-scispacy` flag to have SciSpacy do the tokenization.\"\n",
    "    * This is the most straightforward way to format new data. Since I am using abstracts which are downloaded from PubMed as a `.txt` file, and already have written a (rough) abstract extractor, this is fairly simple. \n",
    "* \"If you'd like to use a pretrained DyGIE++ model to make predictions on a new dataset, the `dataset` field in your new dataset must match the `dataset` that the original model was trained on; this indicates to the model which label namespace it should use for predictions.\"\n",
    "    * In this case, the `dataset` field for the unlabeled data should be `GENIA`"

    "The effect of isoprenoid growth regulators on avocado Persea americana Mill. cv Hass fruit growth and mesocarp 3hydroxy3methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase HMGR activity was investigated during the course of fruit ontogeny. Both normal and smallfruit phenotypes were used to probe the interaction between the end products of isoprenoid biosynthesis and the activity of HMGR in the metabolic control of avocado fruit growth. Kinetic analysis of the changes in both cell number and size revealed that growth was limited by cell number in phenotypically small fruit. In small fruit a 70 reduction in microsomal HMGR activity was associated with an increased mesocarp abscisic acid ABA concentration. Application of mevastatin a competitive inhibitor of HMGR reduced the growth of normal fruit and increased mesocarp ABA concentration. These effects were reversed by cotreatment of fruit with mevalonic acid lactone isopentenyladenine or N2chloro4pyridylNphenylurea but were not significantly affected by either gibberellic acid or stigmasterol. However stigmasterol appeared to partially restore fruit growth when coinjected with mevastatin in either phase II or III of fruit growth. In vivo application of ABA reduced fruit growth and mesocarp HMGR activity and accelerated fruit abscission effects that were reversed by cotreatment with isopentenyladenine. Together these observations indicate that ABA accumulation downregulates mesocarp HMGR activity and fruit growth and that in situ cytokinin biosynthesis modulates these effects during phase I of fruit ontogeny whereas both cytokinins and sterols seem to perform this function during the later phases.\n"

    "Highresolution growth measurements were conducted using a linear variable displacement transformer in conjunction with a temperatureprogrammed meristemcooling collar. Chilling and rewarming profiles were determined for a range of Gramineae in the presence and absence of varying concentrations of gibberellic acid GA3. In wheat Triticum aestivum L. seedlings the growthconstraining temperature Pe was progressively lowered by increasing GA3 concentration with a difference of4.8°C between controls and material treated with 104 M GA3. Dwarf5 maize Zea mays L. seedlings had a higher Pe than tall segregates and the difference was markedly reduced by exposure to a saturating concentration of GA3. A similar effect was observed with Tanginbozu dwarf rice Oryza sativa L.. The growth ratetemperature responses of Rht3 gibberellininsensitive dwarf wheat seedlings were unaffected by GA3 and the Pe values for these segregates were around 5° C higher than for normals. Slender s1 barley Hordeum vulgare L. genotypes had Pe values of7° C compared with 4° C for wildtype material and did not show positive hysteresis for growth rate during the rewarming phase. These studies indicate that GA3 modifies the thermal sensitivity of meristem function in Gramineae in a manner which enhances lowtemperature growth.\n"

    "It's clear that in most cases, the single token sentences could be removed in a second pre-processing step after the dygiepp formatting script is run on them without consequence, as most of them are section headers from within structured abstracts. There are occasional mis-tokenizations that would get caught up there, so if the modeling code works normally on all the other sentences in the same doc I would almost be inclined to leave them, and I believe that's the case based on the wording in the docs."

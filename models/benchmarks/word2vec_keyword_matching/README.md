## Keyword matching with word vector representations
The code in this directory is an extension of the basic, rules-based-only keyword mayching pipeline in the `ontology_keyword_matching` directory. This code also utilizes the keywords obtained by `get_keywords.py` (if you've come directly here without running that for the `ontology_keyword_matching` code yet, please see the [README](https://github.com/serenalotreck/knowledge-graph/blob/master/benchmarks/ontology_keyword_matching/README.md) for detail on how to run that before beginning here), but extends the simple rules-based matching scheme by incorporating word vectors, to match keywords that appear in semantically similar contexts, but may not specifically be keywords from Planteome.
